There are a lot of pieces here, but don't be intimidated — *most* of them are pretty straightforward and we'll take it step by step.\n",

        "For simplicity and transparency, this implementation will use just basic data structures (Python lists and dictionaries, NumPy arrays). In practice this would usually be built into a more organised class structure — we will see examples of this in week 6. If you feel particularly enthusiastic you are welcome to re-engineer these functions into something more elegant. (There are no other \"further exploration\" tasks this week — if you run out of things to do here, reward yourself with some rest and relaxation!)\n",

Plotting functionality is provided, so your output should look similar, though by default the resolution for the class maps will be significantly lower (to avoid scaling issues).\n",
